# Restep
The Restep Power System is currently composed of four Modules:

The Mother Module: the foundation of the power system, much like a Motherboard in a computer

The Battery Charger Module: provides battery charge control, MPPT, and system voltage control

The Off-Line Module: provides power input from a wall outlet

The PV Module: provides power input from a photovoltaic panel
  
All four Modules are at an initial release phase (Rev.X1) 7/14/21. This revision is a prototype release. No Modules are fully tested or qualified.
